check how my integration of openasar mods (https://github.com/GooseMod/OpenAsar) into vesktop (https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) looks (the local repo is the modified vesktop). delete all the test files and all. Delete the things that are already in the original vesktop and also in the openasar. for example vesktop alr offers custom css so theres no need for that. also the descriptions in vesktop settings have too little space, give them as much space as other settings options have. delete the options that are already present from the integration i wrote, and do all that without adding comments.
i just dont want to have the same option added two times if you get me.
